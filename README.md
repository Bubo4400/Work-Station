# Work Station
Couldn't manage to work out notion so made it instead!!!
A little planner environment where you can mainly organise your homework and also add some of your plans for the week.

# How to use:
 - To use just download the Workspace folder and open the index.html file.
 - To customise the cover change the cover.gif file to whatever you want. (currently there's a cover.gif which is the current one and there's a coverW.gif which is a secondary one to use rename the current one and remove the 'W')
 - To customise the colors you can go into the home.css to change the home page colors, and the homework.css to change the colors in the homework page. The style.css is to change the background color and the color or font of the text. (Beware not all of the color of texts are set in the style.css)

# Beware:
 - You can not remove the plans for the Week.
 - It does not currently sync between devices. (Hopefully coming soon)
 - All information older than a month old is considered no longer useful so it is automatically removed to free up room for more information.
