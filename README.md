# Workspace
Couldn't manage to work out notion so made it instead!!!

# How to use:
 - To use just download the Workspace folder and open the index.html file.
 - To customise the cover change the cover.gif file to whatever you want. (currently there's a cover.gif which is the current one and there's a coverW.gif which is a secondary one to use rename the current one and remove the 'W')
 - To customise the colors you can go into the home.css to change the home page colors, and the homework.css to change the colors in the homework page. The style.css is to change the background color and the color or font of the text. (Beware not all of the color of texts are set in the style.css)
